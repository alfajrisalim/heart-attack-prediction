# ❤️ Heart Attack Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient health indicators using machine learning classification algorithms.

## 📌 Project Overview
Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can prevent severe outcomes and give patients a higher chance of survival.

In this project, we:
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessed the dataset (handling missing values, normalization, encoding, etc.)
- Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

## 🔬 Dataset
The dataset contains patient medical features including:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| age      | Age of the person |
| sex      | 0 = female, 1 = male |
| trtbps   | Resting blood pressure |
| chol     | Cholesterol level |
| thalachh | Maximum heart rate |
| cp       | Chest pain type |
| ...      | and more clinical health variables |
